Artificial intelligence  

**BFS FIRST SUM ALGORITHM**
(Start Node = A)
Represent the graph using an adjacency list
Create an empty queue Q
Create an empty list Visited
Add A to Visited
Enqueue A into Q
While Q is not empty do
    Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode
    Visit CurrentNode
    For each neighbor of CurrentNode do
        If neighbor is not in Visited then
            Add neighbor to Visited
            Enqueue neighbor into Q
        End If
    End For
End While
End BFS

**BFS SECOND SUM ALGORITHM**
(Start Node = 1)
Represent the graph using an adjacency list
Create an empty queue Q
Create an empty list Visited
Add 1 to Visited
Enqueue 1 into Q
While Q is not empty do
    Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode
    Visit CurrentNode
    For each neighbor of CurrentNode do
        If neighbor is not in Visited then
            Add neighbor to Visited
            Enqueue neighbor into Q
        End If
    End For
End While
End BFS

**BFS THIRD SUM ALGORITHM**
(Start Node = 1)
Represent the graph using an adjacency list
Create an empty queue Q
Create an empty list Visited
Add 1 to Visited
Enqueue 1 into Q
While Q is not empty do
    Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode
    Visit CurrentNode
    For each neighbor of CurrentNode do
        If neighbor is not in Visited then
            Add neighbor to Visited
            Enqueue neighbor into Q
        End If
    End For
End While
End BFS

**BFS FOURTH ALGORITHM**
(Start Node = 0)
Represent the graph using an adjacency list
Create an empty queue Q
Create an empty list Visited
Add 0 to Visited
Enqueue 0 into Q
While Q is not empty do
    Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode
    Visit CurrentNode
    For each neighbor of CurrentNode do
        If neighbor is not in Visited then
            Add neighbor to Visited
            Enqueue neighbor into Q
        End If
    End For
End While
End BFS
