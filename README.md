Artificial intelligence  

**BFS FIRST SUM ALGORITHM**
1. Represent the graph using an adjacency list.

2. Create an empty queue Q.

3. Create an empty list Visited.

4. Add A to Visited.

5. Enqueue A into Q.

6. While Q is not empty do:
   a. Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode.
   b. Visit CurrentNode.
   c. For each neighbor of CurrentNode do:
      i. If neighbor is not in Visited then:
         - Add neighbor to Visited.
         - Enqueue neighbor into Q.
      ii. End If
   d. End For

7. End While

8. End BFS

**BFS SECOND SUM ALGORITHM**
1. Represent the graph using an adjacency list.

2. Create an empty queue Q.

3. Create an empty list Visited.

4. Add 1 to Visited.

5. Enqueue 1 into Q.

6. While Q is not empty do:
   a. Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode.
   b. Visit CurrentNode.
   c. For each neighbor of CurrentNode do:
      i. If neighbor is not in Visited then:
         - Add neighbor to Visited.
         - Enqueue neighbor into Q.
      ii. End If
   d. End For

7. End While

8. End BFS

**BFS THIRD SUM ALGORITHM**
1. Represent the graph using an adjacency list.

2. Create an empty queue Q.

3. Create an empty list Visited.

4. Add 1 to Visited.

5. Enqueue 1 into Q.

6. While Q is not empty do:
   a. Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode.
   b. Visit CurrentNode.
   c. For each neighbor of CurrentNode do:
      i. If neighbor is not in Visited then:
         - Add neighbor to Visited.
         - Enqueue neighbor into Q.
      ii. End If
   d. End For

7. End While

8. End BFS

**BFS FOURTH ALGORITHM**
1. Represent the graph using an adjacency list.

2. Create an empty queue Q.

3. Create an empty list Visited.

4. Add 0 to Visited.

5. Enqueue 0 into Q.

6. While Q is not empty do:
   a. Dequeue a node from Q → CurrentNode.
   b. Visit CurrentNode.
   c. For each neighbor of CurrentNode do:
      i. If neighbor is not in Visited then:
         - Add neighbor to Visited.
         - Enqueue neighbor into Q.
      ii. End If
   d. End For

7. End While

8. End BFS
End While
End BFS
